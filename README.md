# [Welcome to the Funbite Github Page](https://skittlq.github.io/funbite-2023/)

This project was created using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

Funbite is a small project of mine that will slowly be built bigger and bigger as I learn more about react.js. It started out as an [IST Assignment in school](https://github.com/Skittlq/ist-assignment2022), at first I thought this was really cool, I made a functional website featuring my own HTML, CSS and Javascript, but after finding react.js, I learnt that the website I made was absolutely horrible, so I got this cool idea of recreating the Funbite website using my new-found knowledge on react.js, and if I move this off of Github Pages, maybe even node.js.

## But why?

React.js is just so much faster, there are literally no loading times when going between pages, and the file structure will be so much better for me and you if you want to snoop around the files, improve on that crappy excuse of mobile responsiveness on that old site, and obviously so that I can ~~impress/show-off~~ educate my teacher about this!

## Where can I find you?

I got [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Skittlq_), [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/Skittlq) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/Skittlq) not "The Hub" unfortunately.
